# ðŸ§® FCFS CPU Scheduling Simulation in C++  
**By Tahim Bhuiya**

This project implements a **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm** with support for **I/O bursts** in **C++**. It simulates process execution with alternating CPU and I/O bursts, and computes performance metrics like **waiting time**, **turnaround time**, **response time**, and **CPU utilization**.
